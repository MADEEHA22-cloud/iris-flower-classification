# Iris Flower Classification 🌸

This project is part of the **NSP NEXUS Internship - Week 1** task. The objective is to build a simple machine learning model to classify iris flowers into one of three species using their sepal and petal measurements.

## 👨‍💻 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- pandas, numpy
- seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## 📊 Dataset
Used the built-in Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.

Features:
- Sepal length, Sepal width
- Petal length, Petal width

Target classes:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## ✅ Steps Performed
1. Loaded the dataset
2. Explored and visualized the data
3. Preprocessed the data
4. Trained a classifier (Decision Tree)
5. Evaluated model performance
6. Visualized the confusion matrix

## 📈 Results
Achieved high accuracy with the Decision Tree model. Evaluation metrics included accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## 🔗 Submission
This notebook is submitted as part of the internship Week 1 task.  
Project uploaded to GitHub for review.
